Time Management 

Time management is very important to game development because if a person does not have good time management skills then they will not be able to complete tasks under such harsh time constraints, they will also not be able to work well within teams as they will be forever pulling down people in their group for not doing work. In my own work time management was very important but I did not apply it very well to my work as I left much of my work to the last-minute meaning that my work was not as good as it could have been. This meant that my work and my group for pre-production suffered, although I picked it up for the last few weeks. A different outcome to my work could have been achieved if I had made sure that my time management was good at the beginning of term.

Team Work

Team work is one of the most important factors in the game industry because if teams do not work well together then their individual abilities are not maximized. This damages the work that they produce and possibly stops development from happening at all. In all our coding task, we have been in groups and if I had communicated well with my partner we may have been able to achieve a higher grade in our paired work. In our pre-production groups, we weren’t communicating well and as scrum master for some time, I should have noticed that and sorted the problem out and made us more organized. This would have allowed us to finish our pre-production demo to a playable state.

Written Skills 

Written skills are very important in game developement becuas if you do not have good written skills then your code may suffer and your comments will not make sense when being applied to you code. It also means that when writing papers and essays, it may be very hard for someone to read your essay and agree or disagree with your essays if they cannot understand it. In my own work i found that my written skills are lacking, in terms of grammar and referencing works. Synthesizing referenced works was also a problem that I encountered. 

Organization

Organization is very important in the games industry because without it, teams and individuals would not be able to work to their full potential and time would be lost. This could make or break a project, if organization is not practiced then a development project that should last 6 months could last a year. This is because of booking spaces, hiring staff, assets etc. Organization stopped me from achieving the highest-grade I could achieve, the reason for this is because I was not organized and dedicated to the work I was doing. So, the work I did was sloppy. Within my groups if there was a little organization we could have completed our pre-production relatively early. This meant we could have spent time refining it instead of working right up to the deadline and stressing ourselves out. 

Ability to work under pressure 

The ability to work under pressure is very important because half way through he semester we had not done a lot for our game and I was behind on some work. This meant I had to do the work very fast and very close to a deadline. This made my work sloppy and made it less than it could have been because I felt that anything at a basic level would do. Within my group we worked under pressure a lot because we did not have a proper functioning game. We did a lot of work within the few weeks that we had but the work we did was still full of mistakes.

Semester 2

TeamWork?

This symester were put into teams working with other disiplines such as artists, designers and animators. At the beginning of the project If we had communicated more and met up often to work on the game. Then the game would be in much better state than it is now. The reason that our game is less than it could have been is because we did not hold meetings as frequently as we could have, also we did not talk to designers about what they wanted. So our game became scattered until about half way through the symester.

Learning New Programming Languages

Learning new programming languages is needed in the games industry as you do not know which system or engine you will be using and what language runs on that system. This means that it is very useful for an individual to learn new programming languages as to increase their employability. This semester because we switched from python to unreal engine we had to learn C++. I found this to be quite hard but enjoyable as I found that C++ was much more fun to use then python. The diffuculty came when I learned that C++ was so different to python. The way I overcame this was that I used tutorials and the worksheets that we were given to at least learn the basics of C++ and this helped to complete the work I was given. I plan to use C++ and unreal engine to make some games as to further my knowledge in C++ for second year.

Learning to Apply Programming Concepts

Learning to apply programming concepts to work is need in the games industry because it becomes very ineficcient in a company when you have to hire someone else to make up the theory and someone else to implement it in engine or in code. I had this problem during the group game as one of my puzzles had platoforms and I needed to activate a matinee when the platforms reached a certain point on their Z axis. I knew what I wanted to do but did not know how to implement it. I solved this by asking a tutor how they would implement it and walk me through it step by step. After that I have been improving on implementing my theorys in how to program a certain problem.
