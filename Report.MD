Time Management 

Time management is very important to game development because if a person does not have good time management skills then they will not be able to complete tasks under such harsh time constraints, they will also not be able to work well within teams as they will be forever pulling down people in their group for not doing work. In my own work time management was very important but I did not apply it very well to my work as I left much of my work to the last-minute meaning that my work was not as good as it could have been. This meant that my work and my group for pre-production suffered, although I picked it up for the last few weeks. A different outcome to my work could have been achieved if I had made sure that my time management was good at the beginning of term.

Team Work

Team work is one of the most important factors in the game industry as if teams do not work well together then their individual abilities are not maximized. This damages the work that they produce and possibly stops development from happening at all. In all our coding task, we have been in groups and if I had communicated well with my partner we may have been able to achieve a higher grade in our paired work. In our pre-production groups, we weren’t communicating well and as scrum master for some time, I should have noticed that and sorted the problem out and made us more organized. This would have allowed us to finish our pre-production demo to a playable state.

Written Skills 

Organization

Organization is very important in the games industry because without it, teams and individuals would not be able to work to their full potential and time would be lost. This could make or break a project, if organization is not practiced then a development project that should last 6 months could last a year. This is because of booking spaces, hiring staff, assets etc. Organization stopped me from achieving the highest-grade I could achieve, the reason for this is because I was not organized and dedicated to the work I was doing. So, the work I did was sloppy. Within my groups if there was a little organization we could have completed our pre-production relatively early. This meant we could have spent time refining it instead of working right up to the deadline and stressing ourselves out.
