## Week 1

Weekly journal goes here. Reflect.

Week 1 

This week we had our first lecture to do with the history of computing. Nothing in this lecture was that new to me. For the rest of the week we had the Lego robot Olympics which was slightly challenging on the first day because I did not understand how the programming function on the robot worked, but after the first day it started to make sense. 

Week 2 

The first lecture of the week was to do with the Python IDE and how to use variable, loops and conditionals. These were slightly challenging at first but after the lecture I understood these to a good extent. 
The next lecture was about game design practises. In this lecture we got into groups and brainstormed board games in the first half, while in the second lecture we made a prototype of the board games that we thought up. This was challenging because of time constraints and that I had never had to brainstorm a game from scratch before. 
In the last lecture of the week we started learning how to program in pairs, we started a challenge that was difficult at first but once we actually looked at the code it was very easy.

Week 3 

This week in the first lecture we looked at flowcharts and pseudocode, pseudocode was the only new thing that I learned in the lecture it was not that difficult to understand. In the second lecture of the week we looked at making a text based adventure game which was fun and exciting. Difficulties for this were not making the game too ambitious and adding too many features to the game. Also actually being able to make the prototype in the timeframe we were given. In the second lecture of that day we started looking at our agile essays and started thinking of questions that we could do our project on. For the last lecture of the week we started looking at tinkering with text this was probably the most difficult activity that I had done because I could just not get the code to work.
