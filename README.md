## Week 1

Symester 1

Week 1 

This week we had our first lecture to do with the history of computing. Nothing in this lecture was that new to me. For the rest of the week we had the Lego robot Olympics which was slightly challenging on the first day because I did not understand how the programming function on the robot worked, but after the first day it started to make sense. The reason I made sense of this is because I asked a teammate, who knew what they were doing with the robot. They taught me how to use it.

Week 2 

The first lecture of the week was to do with the Python IDE and how to use variable, loops, and conditionals. These were slightly challenging at first but after the lecture I understood these to a good extent. 

The next lecture was about game design practices. In this lecture, we got into groups and brainstormed board games in the first half, while in the second lecture we made a prototype of the board games that we thought up. This was challenging because of time constraints and that I had never had to brainstorm a game from scratch before. By the end of the lecture I understood how to brainstorm a game and the basic time constraints of making a prototype board game. 

Week 3

In the second lecture of the week we looked at making a text based adventure game which was fun and exciting. Difficulties for this were not making the game too ambitious and adding too many features to the game. Also, being able to make the prototype in the timeframe we were given.

In the second lecture of that day we started looking at our agile essays and started thinking of questions that we could do our project on. 

For the last lecture of the week we started looking at tinkering with text this was probably the most difficult activity that I had done because I could just not get the code to work. By the end of lecture, I still could not get the code to work so I looked at it out of lesson hours. It slowly started to make sense but I still can’t code colors.

Week 4

For the COMP 110 lecture we looked at logic gates and computer memory. Logic gates were very confusing at first because symbols were very similar and there were so many of them. But after looking at them during the break on logic, I did not have a problem with them anymore. 

In the COMP 150 lecture we got into groups and started brainstorming a text based adventure game this was easy until we started to code the game. Which seemed to be a bit harder than we had anticipated, this meant we had to cut a lot of the features that we thought we were going to implement. The coding of the game was also difficult, but when pair programming with someone in the group it became a lot easier and the concepts became a lot easier to understand. 

Week 5

For the COMP 110 lecture this week we looked at big O notations which did not seem difficult in the lecture but once I looked at, Worksheet C I became very confused, to overcome this I talked to one of my classmates who did understand what they were doing. They guided me through what I did not understand. 

In the COMP 150 lecture we had to prepare our handouts and pitches for my game idea this was hard because I did not have a coherent game idea, which made it harder to make a handout and think of points for said handout. I did not overcome this and the ideas I had were sub-par, this made my pitch and handout very bad and unprofessional in my opinion. 

For the COMP 120 task we looked at changing the color of images and pixels in an image, this is the hardest task that I have done so far. Even after looking at it after lessons I still did not understand how this was done, I think this is because the python tutorials online do not go into that much detail into what you need to do.

Week 6
For COMP 120 I was still confused on the technique to change colors of images, even with looking through the notes of the lecture and working out of lessons I still could not wrap my head around it.

Week 7

For COMP 120 we did a peer review of each other’s work, what I learned from this is that I don’t follow PEP-8 very well and that the sophistication of my code was not very good.

Week 8

For COMP 150 we started tinkering audio which I found very difficult to follow but after discussing with my peers, about solutions we found a way to solve it.

For COMP 150 we had our sprint review, the problem we faced was that we had possibly made the scope too broad. This meant we were wasting time on small things like a menu, so after discussing with our tutor we decided to scale down our scope slightly.

Week 9

I had no problems this week.

Week 10

For COMP 110 we were introduced to C++ which seemed difficult because of the small changes that made it different to python and how we had to prepare them. But after looking further into C++ it does not seem much more difficult.

For COMP 150 we had an academic peer review, my essay had lots of flaws because I decided to change my question at the last moment, this meant my draft was not as good as it could've been.

Week 11

For COMP 110 this week we looked at mathematics for computing professionals, which I am very weak on, over the Christmas period I am going to try to update my math’s knowledge to help me with this problem.

For COMP 150 we had our second sprint review, at this point we did not have a game or many mechanics and were panicking about the outcome of our pre-production task. But in the session, we managed to fix and add quite a lot of what was wrong with our code.

Week 12

For COMP 150 we had our presentation to investors which we were severely under prepared for and our pre-production task was not good at all, since it was not a game and merely a jumbled batch of mechanics.

Symester 2

Week 1
I had no problems this week.

Week 2
For COMP 140 we looked at colletions and generic types I found this to be quite confusing but I plan to to read more about it later this week. 

For COMP 160 we looked at UML diagrams this was relativly easy but I am still confused on how to do it properly so I plan to research it later.

Week 3
For COMP 130 we looked at advanced OOP design I missed this lecture but read the slides and understood most of it but will need to do further research to fully grasp this concept.


Week 4
I had no problems this week.

Week 5

This week for COMP 160 we looked at SQL and databases, these concepts were interesting but quite complicated to learn in one session. So I plan to look at the slides later in the week to try and understand hese concepts fully.  

Week 6

For Comp 140 we were introduced to our arduinos where we made some LEDS light up. This was very interesting and I plan to do some more work with the arduino at home. For COMP 160 this week we looked at UNIX servers and databases
